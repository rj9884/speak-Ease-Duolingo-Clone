# Speak Ease (Language Learning Platform)

![Home Page](frontend/public/images/home.png)

Speak Ease is a comprehensive, gamified language learning platform inspired by popular apps like Duolingo. Built entirely on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), it offers a highly engaging environment for users to learn new languages through interactive lessons, quizzes, and vocabulary tracking.

The application features a premium, high-contrast **"Neo-Brutalist Gamified"** frontend design. By leveraging bespoke CSS variables and dynamic animations, the UI delivers an exciting and visually striking experience that stands out from generic templates.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally. For a more visual cross-platform guide, please refer to the [setup.md](setup.md) file.

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: v18.0.0 or higher.
- **MongoDB**: A running local MongoDB instance or a MongoDB Atlas URI.

### Installation

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AP24110011314/speak-Ease-Duolingo-Clone.git
cd speak-Ease-Duolingo-Clone
```

**2. Setup Backend**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```
Create a `.env` file from the example and configure your environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Ensure your `MONGO_URI` is correctly set in `.env` (e.g., `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/speakease`). Next, seed the database with initial languages and lessons:
```bash
node seed.js
```
Start the backend server:
```bash
npm start
```

**3. Setup Frontend**
Open a new terminal window:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to start learning!

---

## Available Scripts

In the **backend** directory:
- `npm start`: Runs the production server.
- `npm run dev`: Runs the server in watch mode using native node watch.
- `npm test`: Runs the Jest test suite.

In the **frontend** directory:
- `npm run dev`: Starts the Vite development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the React app for production.
- `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint for code quality.

---

## Testing

The backend is fully equipped with an automated test suite using **Jest** and **Supertest** along with an in-memory MongoDB server (`mongodb-memory-server`) to ensure robust API endpoints without affecting your development database.

To run tests:
```bash
cd backend
npm test
```
